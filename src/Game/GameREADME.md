# Current Framework:


- _GameManager_ is responsible for all rules and logic of the game as well incrementing the turn
- _Board_ is a representation of the board
- _Player_ contains all the information a single player knows about the game. It makes decisions each turn based on the information it knows
- _develop.py_ is an example script which instantiates all game classes and calls the run function
